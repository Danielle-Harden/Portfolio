        About Me 
        I am a student in the UW Coding Bootcamp. So far we are learning HTML and CSS, as well as how to use 
        tools such as Visual Studio, GitLab, GitHub, Slack.
        
        I was so excited to create my first website! There is a steep learning curve and I am feeling overwhelmed 
        and a sense of dread, but a few things are starting to click!

        Keeping it in perspective, as I am more worried about climate change and the 6th extinction in progress.
